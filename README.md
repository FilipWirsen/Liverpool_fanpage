# UX
### For the design i wanted to keep things simple and used Liverpools official page as an inspiration for things as the color scheme and the article content.

# Design

### For the color scheme i wanted to go for Liverpools official colors so the colors that are used for this project are the following
#### Header and navigation background: #C8102E 
![red-color](assets/images/red-color.png)
#### Body background #F0F0F0
![white-color](assets/images/white-color.png)
#### Footer background is #3a3a3a
![gray-color](assets/images/gray-color.png)

## Home Page
### For the home page i wanted it to be easy to see that you can click the boxes to read the full article so i used shadowboxing witch i got via [getcssscan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples)

## Full Article

### All of the content from the full article section are taken from [Liverpools official site](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/) and iÂ´ve added a link to the bottom of each article witch takes the user to the real article

## Schedule Page

### For the Schedule page i wanted to show when, where and who were playing so i used the table attribute to add all the data i wanted per row. I also wanted to seperate the rows so the user easily can see the content that corresponds to the game they are looking at so i used the :hover selector to change the color of the whole row to a Liverpools green color (#00b2a9)

## Newsletter Page

# Error and Validation
### All pages were validated using [w3.org](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) for CSS and [w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) for HTML

### When validating the schedule page i got the following warning 
![Error from validiating schedule page](assets/images/error-schema.png)
### I fixed this by adding the colspan attribute to the table header
