                        <p>
                            JÃ¼rgen Klopp opted to make eight changes for the encounter at San Siro, where his side came from a goal down to win 2-1 thanks to finishes from Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi. That result saw the Reds make
                            history as they became the first English club to win all six of their games in a Champions League group phase.

                        <p>
                            The Reds were denied three points at Stamford Bridge in a thrilling Premier League battle that they led by two goals in the early stages, courtesy of Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah strikes by the 26th minute. Mateo
                            Kovacic lashed in a volley and Christian Pulisic slotted home an equaliser in a double blow before half-time, though, and nothing could then separate the sides in the second period as both goalkeepers produced
                            vital saves.

                        <p>
                            The visitors had taken firm control of the clash at Stamford Bridge through strikes by Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah in minutes nine and 26 respectively. But the Blues hauled themselves level before half-time as
                            Mateo Kovacic converted a stunning volley and Christian Pulisic then broke through to send a finish beyond Caoimhin Kelleher.
