            <h2>Oxlade-Chamberlain: Milan win shows the team is in a good place</h2>
            <p>Jürgen Klopp opted to make eight changes for the encounter at San Siro, where his side came from a goal down to win 2-1 thanks to finishes from Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi. 

                That result saw the Reds make history as they became the first English club to win all six of their games in a Champions League group phase.</p>

            <h2>Divock Origi: It was a beautiful night at San Siro</h2>
            <p>The Reds completed a perfect group-stage campaign with a sixth victory as strikes by Mohamed Salah and then Origi – with a precise reaction header – overturned a first-half deficit at the iconic San Siro.

                “It was a beautiful night. We enjoyed it,” said Origi, who was named UEFA’s Player of the Match.
                
                “I think as a team we played very well. We all wanted to play our best game, playing in San Siro – a beautiful stadium, a historical stadium – against a very strong team. That’s what we live for.
                
                “We tried to give our best and, in the end, being able to win 2-1, for us is the best thing.”</p>

            <h2>Diogo Jota nominated for PFA Fans' Player of the Month</h2>
            <p>The Liverpool forward bagged three Premier League goals during the month, including a brilliantly composed finish against Arsenal and two close-range strikes versus Southampton.

                That form means he is on the shortlist for the latest PFA monthly prize, alongside Joao Cancelo (Manchester City), Reece James (Chelsea), Teemu Pukki (Norwich City), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal) and Bernardo Silva (Manchester City).</p>
